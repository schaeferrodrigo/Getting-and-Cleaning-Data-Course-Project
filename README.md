<h3>In this Repository we have:</h3>

<ul>
<li>
CodeBook.md - in this is explained the data set and the changes
</li>
<li>
run_analysis.R - The code in R with the proccess of analysis of the data set
</li>
<li>
Mean_data.csv -The data obtained with the code in run_analysis.R
</li> 
<li>
data - This folder contain the original data set.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>  Main Goals:</h3>

The analysis described here had 5 main points:

<ul>
<li> to join train set and test set  (we use the function rbind()) </li>
<li> to extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  (we use the grep() )</li>
<li> to descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set </li>
<li> to set appropriate labels with descriptive variable names. </li>
<li>  to create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
<ul>


<h4>External packages</h4>
